@W: MT529 :"/home/jco1147/ray_tracer/github/RayTracer/sv/accumulate/accumulate.sv":32:0:32:5|Found inferred clock accumulate|clock which controls 393 sequential elements including dist_min[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
