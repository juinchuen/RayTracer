@W: MT529 :"/home/jco1147/ray_tracer/github/RayTracer/sv/fifo.sv":62:4:62:12|Found inferred clock ray_tracer_top|clock which controls 11924 sequential elements including INPUT_RAY_FIFO.empty. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
